<p>Graphast is a framework tool that allows users to compose a number of user-generated network models, data importing/exporting services as well as query services, in order to quickly build applications on time-dependent road networks. The main goal is to allow users to implement solutions to different types of problems on time-dependent road networks using spatial queries, such as nearest neighbor queries, optimal sequenced routes, etc. With Graphast users can choose to combine facilities provided by the framework via a public API and/or build their own facilities, e.g., a new query processing algorithm, and incorporate those into Graphast for others to use them as well.</p>

<p>We assume that the structure of a time-dependent road network is modeled by a graph where the vertices represent starting and ending points of road segments or intersections. Those are connected by edges and the cost to traverse these edges vary with time. More formally, the network is modeled by a time-dependent graph (TDG) <i>G = (V,E,C)</i>, where <i>V</i> is a set of vertices, <i>E</i> is a set of edges and the cost (time in our domain of interest), represented by <i>C</i>, to traverse an edge is a function of the departure time.</p>

<p>We assume that <i>C</i> is a set of piecewise-linear functions that are defined in the interval [0, <i>T</i>] where <i>T</i> is a domain-dependent time length. For each edge <i>(u, v)<i>, a function <i>c_{(u,v)}(t)</i> gives the cost of traversing <i>(u, v)</i> at the departure time <i>t &#8712 [0, T]</i>. We also assume that the travel times of the edges in the network follow the FIFO property, i.e., an object that starts traversing an edge first has to finish traversing this edge first as well. The general time-dependent shortest path problem is NP-hard, but it has a polynomial time solution in FIFO networks.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
